After transfer, what did I actually get? What did I lost? Do I regrate to transfer to U of I? 

Come on, you are so cool. There are only a few people get CS+ offer
======
Am I? Am I a really smart student? Am I a hardworking student? I doubt it. I still can't be the top student at U of I. I've spent many days trying to figure out how to complete the MPs, haven't achieved a high rank in the malloc competition, and have no time for sports. It seems I spend so much time studying, yet I haven't seen good outcomes in academics. I'm not cool. Even kinda stupid.

What did I get?
======

So much. I enjoyed studying at U of I. I enjoyed the high-quality courses, fun machine problems, and interesting professors. I can use many resources. I have the opportunity to get involved in a research project. Being able to truly allocate my time, I can focus on my interests instead of some stupid political courses. I can discover the areas I enjoy, without being forced to learn everything. 

What did I lost?
======

All my old friends -I truely miss them. The delicious and low-cost food. Money, a lot of Money. My time, as well as the time that I can company with my parents. Some vain title - I'm no longer a pure Computer Science student any more. A lot of people said CS+ is for the people who can't get into CS, most of Tech company HR will throw their resume in to trash bin. Whether it is true or not, it truely hurts me. 

Do i regrate?
======

No. If I had stayed at BJUT, it would have been worse.

What to do next?
======

I'm not really sure. I'm not a talented student with a lot of publications. I'm even struggling in my courses. Pursuing a Ph.D. seems impossible. What about finding a job? I have no internships, no experience. It is extremely difficult for an international Asian male to find a job in the US. What about a Master's degree? I truly don't want to spend more of my parents' money. The future still looks bleak.

The way to survive
=====

Study harder, working harder, eating harder. Oh, don't forget to lossing some weight. Continueing my football(soccer) hobby. Trying to be better. Keep caim and carry on.
